### Account Types
- `Superuser Account`: Ex: root, UID=0. In Linux, the superuser account is known as your systemâ€™s default administrator root. Every Linux system must have at least one root user account. As part of administrative privileges. Unlike other accounts, the home directory of the superuser is in the top-level directory, located at `/root`
- `User Account`: Ex: Bob, Michael, Dave. On modern Linux systems, regular users have UIDs with four-digit numbers starting at 1000. In fact, the first user account you create on your system will usually have UID 1000. By default, regular user accounts have their home directory in the /home directory.
- `System Account`: Ex: ssh, mail, UID 1<99 OR between 500-999. The operating system creates system accounts during its installation. System accounts are used for running operating system components but do not run with superuser privileges.
- `Service Account`: Ex: nginx, mercury, three-digit UID, between 100 and 999. Just like system accounts, service accounts don't have a home folder or a default shell. They are assigned /sbin/nologin to refuse logins.
